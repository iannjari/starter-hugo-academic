I am a Software Engineering, aspiring Data Engineer, CS student at KU(2017-'22), based in Nairobi, Kenya.

Lover of hikes🏔️, lemon lime ice cream🍦😁 and travel✈️. In my bucket list are Namimbia 🇳🇦, Morocco, Norway, Germany and Lebanon.

I do share some Spring Boot Knowledge on my [blog](https://www.njari.dev/#posts) and some ML knowledge on [section.io](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/authors/ian-njari/).

I dab in Python (Data Science, ML, Backend), Java (Spring Boot) for backend engineering among others.
I try to peer-mentor other students, e.g. GDSC students with knowledge I've gained over the years in my areas of experience.


My interests are in Data Science and ML in Fintech, Consumer Tech and Telecommunications.
Currently mastering Spring Boot and learning CI/CD, Tensorflow and Keras.
